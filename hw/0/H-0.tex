plagiarism or cheating or if you would prefer not to reflect on a personal

\nextprob{Terminology}
\collab{\todo{}}
% ============================================
% ============================================

Sometimes concepts are taught more than once throughout the curriculum.  Each
time you encounter a concept, your understanding of it is deepened.
For each of the terms or statements below, describe in your own words what they
mean.  This will not be graded for correctness, just whether you have done it or
not.  Answering these to the best of your ability will help the instructor and
TA understand the base knowledge of the students in this class.
I encourage you to meet with a partner or two to refresh yourself on what these
terms mean (if you do, be sure to update the \texttt{collab} command
above!).  However, please keep the web searches to a minimum for this one!  It
is acceptable to answer `I have not heard of this term' or `I have heard of
this, but do not remember what it means.'
